Epoch is an init system (analogous to systemd or upstart)
for Linux by Subsentient. It is intended as a lightweight
solution for lightweight distributions
that don't want a huge mess just to boot up.

It has one unified configuration file, is very small in size,
and it has no external dependencies besides glibc or similar,
and /bin/sh is recommended,
though by passing --disable-shell-by-default to buildepoch.sh,
you can turn off the requirement by default, however you
can still enable the shell by adding ShellEnabled true to
epoch.conf.

The build process only requires an ANSI C89 compliant compiler,
glibc or similar with pthreads and headers, kernel headers,
and a bash-compatible shell.

Epoch is public domain software.
Please visit unlicense.org for more information.

To build the Epoch Init System, execute ./buildepoch.sh, or,
if you wish, see ./buildepoch.sh --help for a list of flags
and options you can use.
