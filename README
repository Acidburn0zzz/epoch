Epoch is an init system (analogous to systemd or upstart)
for Linux by Subsentient. It is intended as a lightweight
solution for lightweight distributions
that don't want a huge mess just to boot up.
It has one unified configuration file, is very small in size,
and it has no external dependencies besides glibc.

Epoch is public domain software.
Please visit unlicense.org for more information.

To build the Epoch Init System, just execute ./buildepoch.sh.
If you export CC, CFLAGS and/or LDFLAGS,
those new settings WILL be honored.
You can add flags like -D'CONFIGDIR="/wherever/you/want/"', 
-D'MEMBUS_SIZE=1024', and -DWEIRDSHELLPERMITTED.
The compiled binary and symlinks will be available in built/.
