Epoch is an init system (analogous to systemd or upstart)
for Linux by Subsentient. It is intended as a lightweight
solution for lightweight distributions
that don't want a huge mess just to boot up.

It has one unified configuration file, is very small in size,
and it has no external dependencies besides glibc or similar,
and although installing a shell for /bin/sh is strongly recommended,
Epoch can be built without it by passing the argument
--disable-shell to buildepoch.sh.
(this comes at the cost of support for any
shell symbols like '&' and any types of quotes.)

The build process only requires an ANSI C89 compliant compiler,
glibc or similar with headers, kernel headers,
and a bash-compatible shell.

Epoch is public domain software.
Please visit unlicense.org for more information.

To build the Epoch Init System, execute ./buildepoch.sh, or,
if you wish, see ./buildepoch.sh --help for a list of flags
and options you can use.
