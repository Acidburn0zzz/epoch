Epoch is a boot system (analogous to systemd or upstart)
for Linux by Subsentient. It is intended as a lightweight
solution for lightweight distributions
that don't want a huge mess just to boot up.
It has one unified configuration file, is very small in size,
and it has no external dependencies besides glibc.

To build the Epoch Boot System, just execute ./buildepoch.sh.
If you export CC, CFLAGS and/or LDFLAGS,
those new settings WILL be honored.
You can add flags like -D'CONFIGDIR="/wherever/you/want/"', 
-D'MEMBUS_SIZE=1024', and -DWEIRDSHELLPERMITTED.
