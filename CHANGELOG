Epoch Init System 1.1 released on 2014-05-15.

Notable changes since 1.0.1:

Features:
* Added support for multiple configuration files via the 'Import' config
global attribute, due to popular request.

* Added support for setting global and object-specific environment
variables via config file via ObjectEnvVar=WIBBLE=Derp herp and
GlobalEnvVar=DERP=Wibble hurr.

* Added the RUNONCE option, which disables objects upon their first run in
a bootup (or in the case of HALTONLY, a shutdown). Useful for
ssh key generation and setup utilities post-install for linux distros.

* Added wrapper for 'shutdown' command, making 'epoch shutdown' possible.
Useful for testing Epoch without destroying your existing init system.

* Added support for objects to be declared without any runlevels.

* -fstack-protector has been added to the default CFLAGS.

* Separated the stop and start halves of 'epoch restart' to add more
verbosity to why an object did not restart.

* Improved process tracking. FORKN now accompanies FORK as an option,
the difference being that FORK will wait for the right object's PID
to become trackable, and FORKN will not. Single-job forks should use FORKN.
Daemons that don't auto-fork  should use FORK.

* Allow running as init when not PID 1, with init/epoch --init.

* Allow calling Epoch's killall5 via:
ObjectStopCommand=KILLALL5 signum secondnum
Both fields after KILLALL5 are optional.

* Improve efficiency of killall5.

* Add support for treating some objects' failure as critical
via STOPFAILCRITICAL and STARTFAILCRITICAL options, respectively.
Failure drops to an attempted emergency shell.

* Added new option, MAPEXITSTATUS, to define what an object's
exit code means. Syntax is ObjectOptions=MAPEXITSTATUS=1,FAILURE
which sets exit code 1 to FAILURE. WARNING and SUCCESS are the other
alternatives.


Bugs:
* Fixed missing help for 'reload' command.
* Fixed bugs in 'epoch status' command.
* Rewrite horrible server/init-side code for 'epoch objrl'.
* Misc other small fixes.

Report ALL bugs to thinkingrodent@gmail.com, don't be shy, or you
can try coming into #epoch on Freenode.net.

I'll also be happy to answer any questions you might have.
