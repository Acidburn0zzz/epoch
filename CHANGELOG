Changes since 1.1.1:

* Cleaned up a huge amount of code that was just fugly as hell. This is the big change.
* Removed unsigned long abuse caused by my (at the time) severe OCD.
* New service status output format. Looks cleaner.
* Extremely deprecated AlignStatusReports attribute completely removed. I doubt even one person will be affected by this.
* Add three new attributes: StartingStatusFormat, FinishedStatusFormat, and
StatusNames to manually specify an alternate service status output format.

* Specific bugfixes:
	* Don't set a config problem check to WARNING after we already found a FAILURE.
	* Fix overwriting service messages, caused by our old status format.
	* Fix inaccurate reporting of scheduled shutdown times, now report seconds too.
